# Snake

This is a classic Snake game implemented in Java using object-oriented programming (OOP) and concurrent programming concepts. The game includes features such as user input handling, grid rendering with a graphical user interface (GUI), collision detection, and snake growth upon eating apples.
The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

## Features

**Snake Movement**: The snake moves based on user input (arrow keys).
**Grid Rendering**: The game grid and snake are rendered using a GUI.
**Apple Generation**: Apples are randomly generated on the grid for the snake to eat.
**Snake Growth**: When the snake eats an apple, its length increases.
**Collision Detection**: The game checks for collisions between the snake and walls or itself.
**Concurrent Programming**: Multiple tasks (input handling, rendering) are handled concurrently for smooth gameplay.


## Folder Structure

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.
